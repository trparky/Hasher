This program is an open source alternative to using the program of the same name written by Karen of Karen's Powertools. This program is written in a modern programming language (VB.NET) as versus what Karen's version which was written in classic VB.

It's fully multi-threaded with support to accept multiple files from Windows Explorer thanks to the interprocess communication link.

I encourage you to look at the source code, read, and understand it. If you want to contribute, please... go right ahead and do so. I'll welcome the help. Submit patches along with a pull request and if the additions are good and will improve the program, I'll approve the pull request and merge it into the main branch.

All active development occurs in the dev branch, that's where changes to the code happen and testing takes place. Only after the changes are proven to be stable does the code from the dev branch get merged into the main branch for public deployment.

**Thursday, August 4th, 2022 Update**

This program is now in maintenence mode. Active development has ceased, only bug fixes will be introduced from this point on but since it's quite a stable program so I figure that even that won't happen. The dev branch for testing new code has been removed as well.

**Friday, December 9th, 2022 Update**

I've done some under the hood improvements and some bug fixes since Thursday, August 4th, 2022.
